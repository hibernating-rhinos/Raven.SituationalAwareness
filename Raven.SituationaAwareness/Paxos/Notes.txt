This paxos implementation behave in a last write win approach with regards to psoposal that
have reached consensus.

In other words, if we got acceptad proposal #4, but not accepted proposal #3, we will still
go ahead and publish that #4 arrived to everyone who cares.

The idea is that we just want whatever censensual decision all the nodes have reached, we don't
care for dropped proposals.
